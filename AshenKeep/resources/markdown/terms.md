# Terms and Conditions

Belief in the **Resurrection of the Dead** is an essential element of the Christian faith. Pursuant to this belief, the **Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila (RCAM)** deems it imperative that bodies of the departed be treated with respect and charity—the burial of the dead being a **Corporal Work of Mercy**. RCAM prefers and encourages the faithful to **bury or entomb** the bodies of their departed loved ones. Since 1983, the Code of Canon Law does not forbid cremation anymore, and RCAM supports the faithful who have chosen cremation for worthy motives to honor the memory of the departed. This church has set aside a portion of its land for the construction of a columbarium, hereinafter referred to as the **Risen Christ Memorial Garden (RCMG)**.
